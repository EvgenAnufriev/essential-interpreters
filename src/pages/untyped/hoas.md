## Higher-Order Abstract Syntax

Reuse the binding machinery from the *host language* (Scala, in our case) in the *object language* (the language we are implementing.)

Remove a class of errors from our programs (programs with free identifiers won't compile) but lost the ability to change the binding semantics.
