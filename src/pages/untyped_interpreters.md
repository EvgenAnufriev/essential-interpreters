# Untyped Interpreters

In this section we discuss classic interpreters for untyped languages. These interpreters are essentially a fold over an algebraic data types.

## A Quick Aside on Types

What do we mean by untyped? Types and safety.

## Interpreters vs Compilers

For our purposes, an interpreter will perform effects, while a compiler will merely transform one algebraic data type to another without performing effects. JIT compilers and abstract interpretation blur the distinction between the two to the point that ultimately it is meaningless. We can all agree, however, that "transpiler" should be eradicated from our vocabulary.

## Arithmetic Expressions

Simple to work with, allow us to explore issues of representation, order of evaluation, and error handling.

## Other Data Types

Add dynamic checks.

## Bindings

Add an environment. Discuss scoping.

## Project

A language for interactive fiction? We might have enough material already that we don't need a big project.
